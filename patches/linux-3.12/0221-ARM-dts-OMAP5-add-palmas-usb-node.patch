Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: OMAP5: add palmas-usb node

Without this node, there will be no palmas driver to notify
dwc3 that a cable has been connected and, without that, dwc3
will never initialize.

[kishon@ti.com: added dt properties for enabling vbus/id interrupts
and fixed vbus-supply value after SMPS10 is modeled as 2 regulators]
