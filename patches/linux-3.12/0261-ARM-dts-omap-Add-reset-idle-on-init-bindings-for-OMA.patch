Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: omap: Add reset/idle on init bindings for OMAP

On OMAP we have co-processor IPs, memory controllers,
GPIOs which control regulators and power switches to
PMIC, and SoC internal Bus IPs, some or most of which
should either not be reset or idled or both at init.
(In some cases there are erratas which prevent an IP
from being reset)
Have a way to pass this information from DT.

Update the am33xx/omap4 and omap5 dtsi files with the
new bindings for modules which either should not be
idled. reset or both. A later patch would cleanup the
same information that exists today as part of the hwmod
data files.
